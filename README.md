### You have reached Fernando's Github!

I am a PhD student at [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) working on UAV
autonomy, embedded systems, event-based perception, and UAV hardware. I am
advised by [M. Ani Hsieh](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/people/ani-hsieh/),
[CJ Taylor](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/people/camillo-j-taylor/), and [Vijay
Kumar](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/people/vijay-kumar/).
You may also want to check the [Kumar Robotics Github](https://github.com/KumarRobotics),
where we upload our code.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in working with me or would
like to collaborate on a project!
